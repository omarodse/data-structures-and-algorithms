# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to my repository, where I document my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms. This repository serves as a personal log of my progress, showcasing my solutions, and the different problem-solving approaches I've learned along the way.

## Introduction

This project is not just about solving problems, but understanding the underlying data structures and algorithms at a deeper level. Each solution is accompanied by my thoughts on the problem-solving process, complexities, and alternative approaches if there are constraints. 

## Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- Develop efficient problem-solving strategies.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topics, with each major section dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithm theme:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- etc.

Within each directory, you'll find a README detailing the problems tackled, along with solutions and explanations.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the solutions and the thought processes behind them. Each directory has its own README for a more detailed discussion on the topics.
Suggestions and feedback are always welcome! If you have any advice or alternative solutions, please feel free to contribute.

## Disclaimer

This repository is meant for educational and practice purposes. All solutions are my own unless otherwise stated.
