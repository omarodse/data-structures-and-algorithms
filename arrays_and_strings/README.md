# Arrays and Strings

This section contains problems and solutions related to arrays and strings.

## Problems

- [Unique Characters](unique_characters.py) - Determines if a string has all unique characters, showcasing different approaches including data structure usage, sorting, and brute force.
- [Palindrome Checker](palindrome_check.py) - Determines if a string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases and punctuation. Showcases two approaches: a straightforward method using Python string methods for preprocessing and an optimized method for better space efficiency.
- [Search Insert Position](search_insert_position.py) - Implements binary search to determine the insert position of a target value in a sorted list. The exercise emphasizes efficient search strategies and handling edge cases.
